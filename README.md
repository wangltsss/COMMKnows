# COMMKnows üì∞

**- Inspiration üí°** <br>
Have you gotten tired of reading tons of news through the website every day and feel exhausted to focus? Living in a
fast-paced lifestyle, we always want to have a  **more efficient way to read the news** and explore what is happening
around the world. Thus, our team wants to develop a responsive website that provides a smarter way for you to read news
on your commuting bus to school or work, in the 10min break between your classes, or when you wait in the line for
today's bubble tea!

**- What is does ‚ùì** <br>
This website will provide you with a brand new to efficiently read the news! It will select 6 worldwide commerce-related
news each day. You are able to see the title, a descriptive image, and a brief introduction for each one. If you are
getting interested in a particular piece of news, clicking the URL provided at the end of each news will direct you to
the original news source.

**- How we built it üíª** <br>

**- Challenges we ran into üßê** <br>
The biggest challenges we ran into are learning Python and the UI design. Although our teammates have some previous
experience in Java, JavaScript, and C, this is our first time using Python to build websites. Thankfully, our coding
experiences in other languages help us a lot! Besides, as we consider that people will more likely read news from their
phones, we want to develop a UI that fits both the phone display size and the website size. And it spent lots of time
for us to improve our UI design to improve the user experience.

**- Accomplishments that we're proud of ü•≥** <br>
The most satisfactory part for us is that we learned a new language and built something truly helpful for our everyday
life! As we agree, the best way to learn a new language is by applying it. This hackathon provided us with a great
opportunity to finally start our learning in Python, and we are hoping to continue our learning after this weekend!
Besides, since our project is highly related to the university students like our teammates, we already introduced our
work to several classmates and got positive feedback! We are excited to learn more about the valuable feedback to
improve our work further.

**- What we learned üìù** <br>
We learned how to code in Python! This is the most valuable learning outcome for our teammates. Moreover, one of our
group members did not have previous experience in using API. As we help each out, she now has a basic understanding of
how API works and how to apply it in our project! Furthermore, this is the first time our group join a hackathon event,
and this project is completely built from scratch. We are happy that we developed more time management and group work
skills through this intense weekend!

**- What's next for COMMKnows üìå** <br>
Due to the time constraint of the hackathon, our group hasn't got the chance to implement the searching function. We do
believe that a searching function will help our users to explore more interesting news beyond our every day 6 pieces,
and we are hoping to further develop this function after this weekend!
